# URL_shortner
URL shortening is a technique on the World Wide Web in which a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) may be made substantially shorter and still direct to the required page. This is achieved by using a redirect which links to the web page that has a long URL. For example, the URL "https://example.com/assets/category_B/subcategory_C/Foo/" can be shortened to "https://example.com/Foo", and the URL "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_shortening" can be shortened to "https://w.wiki/U". Often the redirect domain name is shorter than the original one. 
A friendly URL may be desired for messaging technologies that limit the number of characters in a message.
For example SMS which reduces  the amount of typing required if the reader is copying a URL from a print source, makes it easier for a person to remember.

The aim of the project is to make a url shortner software so that we can share urls esily and audience will also get our messagesv quickly.
